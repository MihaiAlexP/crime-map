# A few notes:
## User can drag the rectangle on map and it will show a markers for each crime
## Clicking a marker will show the crime description
## The most recent month with data is 09 2017
## An improvment would be to add functionality for users to select the date
## Another improvement would be to allow user to resize the selected rectangle
